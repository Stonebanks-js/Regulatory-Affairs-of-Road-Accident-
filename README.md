# Regulatory Affairs of Road Accident Data

## Project Overview

This project analyzes road accident data in India for the year 2020, aiming to identify patterns and insights that can inform regulatory decisions and improve road safety. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, the project seeks to provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the official Indian government portal, data.gov.in, specifically the "Road Accidents in India 2020" dataset. It includes information on various aspects of road accidents across different states and cities in India. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
